Welcome to Bang! - an Entity Component System framework in C#.
</p>

### How does it work?
This is not, in any way, an engine, but rather a framework that you can use in whatever engine you're comfortable with. I currently use this with **Murder engine**, which is not available (yet!), built on top of MonoGame.

Check our [wiki](https://github.com/isadorasophia/bang/wiki) if you want more details.

### How to use it?
We are on nuget! So you can either use this repository as a submodule or simply add:

```csproj
<PackageReference Include="Murder.Bang" Version="0.0.2-alpha" />
```

Whatever makes you happier. The nuget package should have symbols and source embedded available with Source Link.

### Real-life examples
[Neo City Express](https://github.com/isadorasophia/neocityexpress) was a Ludum Dare game (made in 72h ‚è∞) built on top of **Murder** and **Bang**. I highly recommend checking it out, especially if you're good with learning from examples.
